| 1  |   1670319293101   | We found a bug where if you change the **input.value** of the hiring date of an employee contract, you can modify the date even if the input is *readonly* |
| 2  | 1670319382569 | We think that it's best to use a commit to reference our test plan versions delivery |
| 3  | 1670319750376 | Commit c1aefcac148967c35d27f16f356816d9a8e8ef4f now references the `1.0.3` version |
| 4  | 1670320624961 | We forgot to add the test id:21 `name and email should be displayed when deleting an employee` in the the test plan v1.0.2, but we're adding it in the v1.0.3 (https://github.com/azerpas/efrei-2023-st2-tst-prj-i/issues/2) |
| 5  | 1670321295591 | We noticed that the bug `Fix bug when editing second line of address` that should have been fixed in v1.0.3 is still not fixed (https://github.com/azerpas/efrei-2023-st2-tst-prj-i/issues/16) |
| 6  | 1670321758517 | We discovered that an employee can only have one team, thus we added a test |
| 7   | 1670322737162 | We discovered that a team name must be unique |
| 9   | 1670322737162 | We chose to implement the page object model for our tests |
| 10   | 1672743948426 | We ask ourselves if it was worth it and useful to implement the homepage |
