| 1  |   1670319293101   | We found a bug where if you change the **input.value** of the hiring date of an employee contract, you can modify the date even if the input is *readonly* |
| 2  | 1670319382569 | We think that it's best to use a commit to reference our test plan versions delivery |
| 3  | 1670319750376 | Commit c1aefcac148967c35d27f16f356816d9a8e8ef4f now references the `1.0.3` version |
| 4  | 1670320624961 | We forgot to add the test id:21 `name and email should be displayed when deleting an employee` in the the test plan v1.0.2, but we're adding it in the v1.0.3 |
| 5  | 1670321295591 | We noticed that the bug `Fix bug when editing second line of address` that should have been fixed in v1.0.3 is still not fixed |
